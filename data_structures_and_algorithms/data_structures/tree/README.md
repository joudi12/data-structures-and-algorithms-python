# Trees
### Binary Tree is a special data structure used for data storage purposes.

### Binary Search tree exhibits a special behavior. A node's left child must have a value less than its parent's value and the node's right child must have a value greater than its parent value.

# challenge ;)
creating  a tree that can be traversed with 3 different methods and adding nodes using binary search.

# Approach & Efficiency :)
creat class have multipal method
## API :)
- Pre-order: root >> left >> right
- In-order: left >> root >> right
- Post-order: left >> right >> root
- add--> accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree. - - contains--> accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
