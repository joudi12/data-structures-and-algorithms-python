# Stacks and Queues
## Description
### Stacks and Queues are pure computer science fundamentals that every developer needs to understand. And so, the best way to illustrate any data structure concept is by building it from scratch


## Challenge
Write queue and stack classes with their methods
## Methods
### Stack methods:
- push() – Adds a new node at the top of the stack
- pop()– Deletes the top most element of the stack
- Peek() - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack.
- IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
### Queue methods:
- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
